# Certificate Tampering Detection System

This project is a lightweight prototype to detect tampered or fake PDF certificates using techniques like:
- PDF metadata analysis
- Layout/image-based comparison
- Textual anomaly detection

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run this in the terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2.Extract and Compare PDF Metadata

    python scripts/metadata_checker.py
Extract Text from Suspicious PDF

3.Extract Text from Suspicious PDF
    ```bash 
    
    python scripts/text_extractor.py


4.Compare Textual Content
            
    python scripts/textual_diff_analyzer.py

    
Run Image Layout Matching
(You must convert PDFs to images before this step.)

5.Run Image Layout Matching
(You must convert PDFs to images before this step.)
   
   
    python scripts/layout_matcher.py
Detect Image Differences

6.Detect Image Differences

    python scripts/image_diff_detector.py


üí° Suggestions
Add more known templates to the originals/ folder for improved layout verification.

Integrate OCR (Tesseract) for full image-to-text tampering detection (bonus).

Export all results into a single JSON or PDF report.
